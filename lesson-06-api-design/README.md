# Lesson 06: API Design & Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Design RESTful APIs for insurance systems
- Implement event-driven integration patterns
- Define API contracts and documentation
- Integrate with external systems (payment, KYC, reinsurance)

## Sub-Lessons

### [6.1 RESTful API Design](./01-restful-api-design/README.md)
Learn the fundamentals of designing RESTful APIs for insurance systems, including endpoint structure, resource naming conventions, and HTTP method usage.

### [6.2 Request/Response Patterns](./02-request-response-patterns/README.md)
Explore detailed examples of request and response patterns for common insurance operations like quote creation and claim registration.

### [6.3 Error Handling](./03-error-handling/README.md)
Understand standard error response formats, error code categories, and HTTP status code usage in insurance APIs.

### [6.4 Pagination & Filtering](./04-pagination-filtering/README.md)
Learn how to implement efficient pagination and filtering mechanisms for API endpoints handling large datasets.

### [6.5 Event Schema Design](./05-event-schema-design/README.md)
Discover event-driven architecture patterns, event envelope structures, and key events in insurance systems.

### [6.6 External Integrations](./06-external-integrations/README.md)
Explore integration patterns for connecting with external systems like payment gateways, KYC services, and reinsurance systems.

## Key Takeaways

1. **REST API design** should follow consistent conventions
2. **Error handling** must be informative and actionable
3. **Pagination and filtering** enable efficient data access
4. **Event schemas** should be versioned and well-documented
5. **External integrations** require resilience patterns

## Exercises

1. Design API endpoints for policy endorsement workflow
2. Create an event schema for claim status changes
3. Implement error handling for payment gateway integration
