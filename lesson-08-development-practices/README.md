# Lesson 08: Development Best Practices

## Overview

This lesson covers essential development practices for building maintainable, scalable insurance software systems. You will learn about code organization, design patterns, naming conventions, error handling, logging standards, and code quality principles.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Apply design patterns for insurance systems
- Implement proper code organization and structure
- Follow naming conventions and coding standards
- Handle errors and exceptions effectively
- Implement structured logging for troubleshooting
- Apply clean code principles for maintainable software

## Sub-Lessons

### [8.1 Code Organization](./01-code-organization/README.md)
Learn how to structure insurance platform projects with proper separation of concerns, including API layers, domain models, infrastructure components, and shared libraries.

### [8.2 Design Patterns](./02-design-patterns/README.md)
Explore essential design patterns for insurance systems including Repository, Factory, Strategy, State, and Specification patterns with practical implementations.

### [8.3 Naming Conventions](./03-naming-conventions/README.md)
Master consistent naming standards for code elements (classes, methods, variables) and database objects (tables, columns, indexes) in insurance applications.

### [8.4 Error Handling](./04-error-handling/README.md)
Implement robust error handling with exception hierarchies, global exception handlers, and standardized error response structures.

### [8.5 Logging Standards](./05-logging-standards/README.md)
Apply proper logging levels and structured logging practices for effective monitoring and troubleshooting of insurance systems.

### [8.6 Code Quality](./06-code-quality/README.md)
Follow clean code principles covering naming, functions, comments, error handling, and testing best practices.
