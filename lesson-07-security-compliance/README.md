# Lesson 07: Security & Compliance

## Overview

This lesson covers security architecture and compliance requirements for insurance technology systems. Insurance companies handle highly sensitive personal and financial data, making security and regulatory compliance critical components of any InsurTech solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement security architecture for insurance systems using defense in depth
- Design and implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems
- Understand and apply data protection and privacy controls
- Navigate regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Implement comprehensive audit and access control mechanisms
- Apply security best practices based on OWASP guidelines

### [7.3 Data Protection](./03-data-protection/README.md)
Sensitive data classification, data masking rules, and encryption strategies.

### [7.4 Regulatory Compliance](./04-regulatory-compliance/README.md)
Key regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), compliance frameworks, and data retention policies.

### [7.5 Audit Trail](./05-audit-trail/README.md)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Defense in depth** provides multiple security layers to protect insurance systems
2. **RBAC** ensures appropriate access based on user roles and responsibilities
3. **Data classification** determines the level of protection required for each data type
4. **Regulatory compliance** is mandatory for insurance operations
5. **Audit trails** enable accountability, forensics, and compliance verification

## Exercises

1. Design RBAC permissions for a new "Compliance Officer" role
2. Create a data retention policy for health insurance claims
3. Implement GDPR data subject request handling workflow
